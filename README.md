# Stock_Prediction_LSTM
For this project, I used the LSTM(Long Short Tome Memory) model for the prediction of stock prices.
Long short-term memory (LSTM) is a model that increases the memory of recurrent neural networks. Recurrent neural networks hold short-term memory in that they allow earlier determining information to be employed in the current neural networks.
